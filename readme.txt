Download and Activate Elementor.

== Changelog ==
V 1.0.0 Initial Version of Post Plus
V 1.1.0 Added a custom widget category for the Elementor Builder
V 1.2.0 Fixed the custom widget category, so widgets will now display correctly.

== Upgrade Notice ==
Upgrade to latest version to see that all widgets for this plugin will have their own section for easy accessibility!
